This will most likely be a basic class that can handle a static counter not only giving ids, but also saving ones that can be reused. So if an object is destroyed, its id can be reused for another object. Only thing about this is mis-attributing the id to an object, as it should be used to uniquely identify an object, so iterating by one would just be the easiest. Maybe would want to make the identification system be a 64-bit number then.
