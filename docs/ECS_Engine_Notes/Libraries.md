## OpenGL vs. DirectX vs. Vulkan
- Don't want to be stuck on this decision forever. While OpenGL will be very easy to get off the ground, I do not have much experience with DirectX or Vulkan. Vulkan will take much more time than desired to get it up and off the ground. For exploring ECS, OpenGL will probably be the best choice

Ended up going with OpenGL using GLAD loader and am using SDL2 for the window.
